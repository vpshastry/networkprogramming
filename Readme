User Documentation
------------------
All the source files can be compiled using the "make" command.
The Makefile uses the required libraries and compiles the programs.
Just to be safe, do a make clean before another make.

Run the arp process using the arp executable:

./arp

Run the tour using the tour executatble as shown below:

./tour

Command used to bundle the files:
> tar -cvf submission.tar *.[ch] Makefile Readme

Command to be used to un-bundle it:
> tar -xf submission.tar

System Documentation
---------------------
There are two parts to this system ARP and Tour.

---
ARP
---
1. It creates two sockets, one Unix Domain Socket on
  "/tmp/ARP_SUNPATH_51476.sock" and other PF Packet socket with 4383 protocol
  ID. And starts listening on these.
2. Upon request through the areq API, it requests the HWaddr for given IP addr.
3. For this IPaddr it builds an ARP request, adds an incomplete cache entry and
  broadcasts it in the eth0 interface.
4. When it receives a PF Packet it does the below jobs based on below cases.
  i. If it is a ARP Request message for self, adds the sender details in the
    cache and replies with the self's hardware address as unicast message to
    the sender.
  ii. If it is an ARP Request message but not for self but has an entry for the
    sender's IP, updates the cache entry.
  iii. If it is a ARP Response message, it updates the incomplete entry in the
    cache.
5. It handles the cache in a table with IPaddr and HWaddr.
