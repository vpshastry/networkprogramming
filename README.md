# On_Demad_Routing_Network_Programming
In this assignment we will develop and implement :
An On-Demand shortest-hop Routing (ODR) protocol for routing messages in networks of fixed but arbitrary and unknown connectivity, using PF_PACKET sockets. The implementation is based on (a simplified version of) the AODV algorithm.
A client/server time application in which clients and servers communicate with each other across a network; the messages exchanged are transmitted using ODR.
An API that enables applications to communicate with the ODR mechanism running locally at their nodes, using Unix domain datagram sockets.
