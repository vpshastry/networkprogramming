User Documentation
------------------
All the source files can be compiled using the "make" command.
The Makefile uses the required libraries and compiles the programs.

Run the server using the server executatble as shown below:

./server

Run the client using the client executable as shown below:

./client

Make sure you have the server running before you call a service on the client.

System Documentation
---------------------
There are two parts to this system. The server and the client.

To ensure only unicast addresses are bound:
	- Section 22.6 has code that first binds unicast address. We do this same way. 
	- Then it attemps to bind Broadcast address and wildcard address. We do not do this.
Array of structures:
	- We have defined a structure called "interface_info_t". We have defined an array "ii" of this structure.
	- This structure contains fields for sockfd, IP address, netmask and subnet address.
	- As we bind each interface in build_inferface_info() we save the details in this array of structs.
	- We do a "bit-wise and" on the IP address and netmask to get the subnet address and store as a in_addr type. See code for details.
	- We then call print_interface_info() to print the contents of this array for stucts as mentioned in the assignment spec.
